Exactly one year ago on October 29th, 2022, I decided to code every day and commit that code to GitHub. When I started, I barely knew how to program in Python and knew some of the basics of HTML and CSS. Since then, I've learned many languages, my tech stack grew astronomically, achieved a 4.0 GPA in my first year of college, and landed two internships. I've also made many amazing friends and met incredible people along the way. I wanted to make this to share my journey and breakdown what I learned over the past year!

## What I've added to my tech stack

- Languages: Javascript, Java, C#, Swift, Python, HTML, CSS, mySQL/SQLite, Bash
- Frameworks: React, React Native, Node.js, Express.js, Prisma, GraphQL, NextJS, Flask, Tailwind, Saas, Bootstrap, Firebase, MongoDB, Postgres, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Bookeh
- Programs: Git, GitHub, VSCode, XCode, Unity, Unreal Engine 5, Blender, Figma, Notion, Trello, Gimp, Krita, Aesprite
- Misc: Docker, Heroku, Vercel, and many more I probably missed

## Stats and Accomplishments

- Made 112 repositories
- Total of 1,920 (2,063 overall) contributions
- Achieved a total of 10 stars across all repos
- Landed 2 internships, one at [Campus Dive](https://campusdive.com/) as a Full Stack SWE and one at [Sisu VR](http://www.sisuvr.com/) as a Unity VR SWE
- Took ~12 classes per semester to help graduate as soon as possible
- Maintained a 4.0 GPA in my first year of college and am on the Dean's List

## What I've learned

I've learned many things over the past year, but here are 5 of the most important things that stood out to me:

- One of the key factors that hooked me on programming was gamifying projects. For example, when we were learning about canvas in web development for the first time, I took it as an opportunity to make a custom raycasting engine that was similar to old school games like Doom or Wolfenstein. By gamifying projects, I was able to bring out my passions and focused on things that I was interested in instead of doing yet another generic to do list app.

- Pacing yourself and worklife balance is EXTREMELY important. I've hit burnout a number of times and it's not fun. Takes breaks and take care of yourself. Although I love what I'm doing, it's not worth sacrificing your happiness. As my mom always says when I push myself too hard, "everything in moderation".

- Learn. Do. Teach. If you truly want to master something, learn it and do research, practice practice practice, then finally teach it to someone else. This way, you're able to iterate on what you've learned initially and learn through experiences rather than just trying to absorb the material in the beginning.

- The basics of programming really isn't that bad. Once you learn the basics, the real challenge comes with designing complex systems and solving obscure problems. The important part is to break down a problem and go slowly. It's easy to tunnel vision yourself and sometimes all you need is to step away for 5 minutes. Pretty much any hard task is just a series of easy tasks, the trick is to break the hard task down into achievable chunks.

- It's fast to work alone, but you get further with a team. Working solo has its benefits, faster iterations, no version conflicts, and you're in control of all the decision making. However, even though working in a team may be slower at first, with the right team and coordination they're unstoppable. Much like what one of my friends mentioned, "one person on a kayak is faster to get setup and moving, but a group of eight rowers on a medium sized boat will travel much further."
